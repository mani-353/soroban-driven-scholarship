# Soroban-Driven Scholarship

## Project Description

The Soroban-Driven Scholarship project uses the Soroban SDK on the Stellar blockchain to create a secure, transparent platform for managing scholarships. Donors can set up scholarships with specific criteria, and eligible students can apply. Scholarships are automatically awarded and distributed through smart contracts.

## Vision Statement

We aim to revolutionize scholarship management by leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform. Our goal is to eliminate fraud, reduce administrative overhead, and empower both donors and students, ensuring fair and efficient distribution of scholarships.

## Software Development Plan

1. **Requirement Gathering:** Define smart contract functionality and variables for scholarships.
2. **Smart Contract Development:** Implement scholarship creation, application, and awarding using Rust and Soroban SDK.
3. **Testing and Optimization:** Ensure functionality and efficiency on the Stellar network.
4. **Front-end Development:** Create a user-friendly interface for interaction.
5. **Integration and User Testing:** Seamlessly connect front-end with smart contracts and gather user feedback.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy on the Stellar blockchain and launch publicly.
